# 🚗 TETHER — Transparent Vehicle Identity & Verification System

## 🌐 Overview
TETHER is a smart vehicle verification platform designed to modernize how vehicles are authenticated, monitored, and validated during roadside inspections.

The system enables instant verification of vehicle authorization, insurance validity, and security status through a unified digital identity model.

This project demonstrates the core logic of a future-ready vehicle governance system built for hackathon evaluation.
